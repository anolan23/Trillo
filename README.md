# Trillo
This project is for frontend practice.


Here is a web app [dashboard](https://trillo-mu-sable.vercel.app/) I created for a hotel and airfare booking company. It has an assortment of advanced styling using html and scss. The focus of this project was to master flexbox and css animations while making the website fully responsive. Well placed animations were important in this mockup because it allowed for a better user experience.
